# telemetry-formula-SAE
This repo contains LoRa telemetry firmware and software for Virginia Motorsports' Formula SAE car.

The concept of this project is to provide an extensible and flexible telemetry system over LoRa. LoRa is a long range, low footprint option for telemetry. Unlike 5G (which is standard on racing series such as the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC)), it does not require cell service.
