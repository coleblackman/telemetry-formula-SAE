# telemetry-formula-SAE
This repo contains LoRa telemetry firmware and software for Virginia Motorsports' Formula SAE car.

## Motivation

The concept of this project is to provide an extensible and flexible telemetry system over LoRa. LoRa is a long range, low footprint option for telemetry. Unlike 5G (which is standard on racing series such as the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC)), it does not require cell service. LoRa is highly power efficient and resistant to electronic interference, unlike WiFi. It is also less affected by multiple other racing teams using WiFi at the same time, as it has frequency spreading. These characteristics make it well suited to the Formula SAE student electric racecar competition.

## Goals

The main goal of this project is to provide a highly scalable solution. As new cars are constructed every year for the Formula competition at the University of Virginia, requirements for telemetry change and grow annually. For example, in 2024, the team shifted from an internal combusion-driven car to an electric powertrain. This shift drastically changed the type of data generated by the car's computer systems. Now, it has to account for high voltage electrical systems in addition to a low (12V) voltage system. Also, as the team pushes the envelope in terms of performance and driver training, data analytics teams have increased demand for detailed, high-frequency data. This data allows them to analyze either
